# Student Management System (SMS) using Binary Search Tree (BST)

In the present-day educational environment, the adept administration of student information assumes paramount significance for educational institutions. Conventional data management systems routinely grapple with formidable obstacles concerning the systematic organization, storage, and retrieval of substantial student data repositories. To confront and surmount these challenges, this undertaking advances the conception of a sophisticated Student Management System underpinned by the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The amalgamation of BST is expressly engineered to optimize the spectrum of data management operations while expediting streamlined accessibility to student records. This initiative unfolds a comprehensive exploration encompassing the conceptualization, execution, and array of functionalities intrinsic to the SIMS. It conspicuously accentuates the transformative potential of this system in the realm of student information governance within educational establishments.

## Objectives

1. **Student Data Management**: The project aims to manage and store information about students, including their names, IDs, departments, addresses, contact numbers, CGPA, and roll numbers.

2. **Functionalities**:
    - **Admin Login**: Secure access to system administration.
    - **Create Student Account**: Allows users to input and store student information, ensuring unique roll numbers.
    - **Display All Students Information**: Provides a comprehensive list of all stored student data.
    - **Update Student Information**: Enables users to modify student information by searching using roll numbers.
    - **Display Students Sorted by CGPA**: Sorts and displays students based on their CGPA in descending order.
    - **Search Student by Roll No**: Allows users to search for specific students by their roll numbers.
    - **Delete Student by Roll No**: Enables the removal of a student's record using their roll number.
    - **Display Recently Added Student**: Shows information about the most recently added student.
    - **Count Students**: Provides a count of the total number of students in the database.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**: The project offers a text-based menu-driven interface for user interaction.

4. **Data Integrity**: Ensures that student roll numbers are unique to maintain data integrity.

5. **Efficient Searching**: Utilizes a binary search tree to efficiently search for, update, and delete student records.
